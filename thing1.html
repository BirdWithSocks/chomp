                     "Ok so it is 460 BC <br> A very long time ago I know <br> But this is where we can find the 1st old guy Democritus ^3000 <br> He was an Ancient Greek philosopher <br> Democritus was the first person to come up with the idea of an atom <br> Apparently, he came up with it by looking at sand. He thought sand was first a pebble and when you break it down it could go on and on until it's unseeable",
                     "Now it is 347 BC <br> This is where the 2ed old guy is Aristotle ^3000 <br> He was also an ancient Greek philosopher like Democritus <br> He didn’t believe atoms were made up of tiny particles he believed that matter was made up of 5 elements which are: Earth, Air, Water, Fire, Aether",
                     "Now we are going to jump forward in time a bit to 1800 <br> This is around the time John Dalton was alive and he is are 3rd old guy ^3000 <br> Developed the Atomic Theory a few parts of his theory are: <br>		all matter is composed of atoms, <br>		atoms cannot be created nor destroyed, <br>		all atoms of the same element are IDENTICAL, <br>		chemical reactions occur when atoms are rearranged, <br>		compounds are formed by the combinations of two or more different kinds of atoms <br>What parts are true today:<br>		All matter is composed of atoms<br>		Chemical reactions occur when atoms are rearranged compounds are formed by the combination of two or more different kinds of atoms",
                     "Snap crack bang we are in the 1900 where we have J.J. Thomson They are the 4th old guy ^3000 <br> He is the guy that discovered Electrons <br> His experiment used the cathode ray tube <br> How it worked: He sealed a glass container that has two electrons separated by a vacuum, when voltage was applied a <br>stream of electrons was created. He used a magnetic field that moved or facted these particles. <br> Used Plum Pudding Model",
                     "We are not going anywhere for the 5th old guy because he was alive in the 1900 like the 4th <br> The 5th old guy is Robert Millikan ^3000 <br> His experiment was the Oil Drop <br> It worked by dropping droplets of oil between two metal electrodes by balancing downward gravitational <br> force with upward drag and electric forces. <br> He determined the change of an electron <br> His discovery was Elementary Charge",
                     "Still, in the 1900 we have Ernest Rutherford who is the 6th old guy ^3000 <br> He was a British physicist <br> he was the one that Discovered Protons <br> He also discovered that atoms have small charged nucleus surrounded by largely empty space ",
                     "Niels Bohr is the 7th old guy ^3000 <br> Born in Copenhagen on October 7, 1885 <br> He got his Master’s degree in Physics in 1909 and his Doctor’s degree in 1911. <br> He won the Nobel prize in 1922 <br> he was a Danish physicist who helped us understand the atomic structure and quantum theory <br> He also created the Bohr model of the atom which proposed the electrons have a stable orbit around the atom and have discrete levels of electricity",
                     "Old guy number 8 is Dmitri Mendeleev ^3000 <br> ooo a Russian <br> Dmitri Mendeleev, in full Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev (Дмитрий Иванович Менделеев), born January 27 (February 8, Julian calendar), 1834 <br> Dmitri was a Russian chemist and inventor. <br> And was most remembered for the periodic law and the early version of the periodic table. <br> he used his periodic law to predict the properties of eight elements that were yet to be discovered.",
